# Klipspringer

*So, I've decided to take my work back underground. To stop it falling
into the wrong hands.*

This is no longer the place to go for this project, go here instead:
[klipspringer.avadeaux.net](https://klipspringer.avadeaux.net/)

I'm moving away from Github. Why? Because the thing with Git is that
it's distributed, and doesn't need a hub, especially not one that is
controlled by Microsoft! If you want to contribute to the project,
then clone the repo running on the server for my personal domain, set
up a Git repo that I can access, and email me a pull suggestion.

Death to platforms, long live internetworking!
