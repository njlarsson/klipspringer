This directory contains scripts for playing and ripping cds and
dvds. They are not directly transferable to other systems, but may be
a source of ideas.

`abcde.conf` is linked from `~/.abcde.conf`.

The `.desktop` files are Gnome application launchers that can be
linked from (or copied to) `~/.local/share/applications`. It may be
necessary to execute them manually once from the Gnome desktop and set
them to trusted, before it's possible to select them for automatic
launch. And it may be necessary to have the x flag set for the desktop
to execute them, even though they will not be executable from the
command line.
